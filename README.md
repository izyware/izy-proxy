## izy-proxy
IZY Proxy server is part of the Izyware framework for building applications and services using the interactive tools.

It enables developers to focus on creating reusable user experiences instead of spending time building and maintaining code and infrastructure.

## Deployment

```
npm i izy-proxy
cd node_modules/izy-proxy
node app.js
```

If you are using PM2 to manage your node processes, you can:

```
cd node_modules/izy-proxy
pm2 start app.js
```

Make cure the the *cwd* for the server process is set to the location for the izy-proxy installation.
This is important because the *cwd* is used in locating plugin and thirdparty modules.

## Sample Config

Use the following as a guideline:

```

module.exports = {
  port: {
    http: 80,
    https: 443
  },
  proxy: {
    timeoutInMs: 60000
  },
	// Array of plug-in definitions 
	plugins: [
	{
		// Only do this while developing plug-ins
		// This will reload the node modules for plug-in per request 
		reloadPerRequest: false, 
		name: 'apigateway'
	},
	{
		aliases: ['.domain_to_alias_to_izyware.com'],
		// Only do this while developing plug-ins
		// This will reload the node modules for plug-in per request 
		reloadPerRequest: false, 
		name: 'circus',
		bootstrapUrl: 'https://izyware.com/chrome_extension.js',
		cache: {
			folder: '/tmp/izy-circus'
		}
	}
	]
};


```

## Plugins

The tool has an extensive and powerful plugin system that allows you to very easily break your application up into isolated pieces of business logic, and reusable pieces.

### Creating a plugin

Create a plugin by cloning the `default` subfolder under the `plugin` directory. You must also register the plugin in the config file.

## Module Paths

If you wish to access izy modules from the file system, you may customize the module path resolution rulesets defined in:

```
izy-proxy/modtask/config/kernel/extstores/file.js
```

Please refer to the comments in the file to understand how to reference external modules.
